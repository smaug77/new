The Division Algorithm
======================

Divisible: a | b if b = am.

We can have various properties:

    * a | b => a | bc
    * a | b and b | c imply a | c
    * and more.

Theorem: Given a, b \in Z, with a > 0, there exist ! integers q, r such that b
= qa + r, with $0 \le r < a$.

To prove, consider all numbers of the form b - qa. This must have a smallest
non-negative number. You can prove this is r.
